# The scripts 1.Assign_taxonomy.R, 2.Transform_data.R and 2.ANCOM_BC.R all process the 16S amplicon data output from the Qiime2 pipeline.

# 1.Assign_taxonomy uses the RDP database to assign taxonomy to the 16S amplicon data

# 2.Transform_data plots and estimates the richness of the 16S amplicon data, transform the data to even sampling depth, 
# performs NMDS ordination, and plots relative abundance with and with ASVs belong to Pseudoalteromonas piscicida B39bio at different taconomic levels.

# 3.ANCOM-BC performs the ANCOM-BC analysis on different taxonomic levels and calculate and calculate and plot the log fold change between the 
# two setups (control and P.piscicida B39bio coated).
